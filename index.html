        English teacher for 11 years and Ed-Tech coordinator for the last one. I 
        taught myself to use Unity 3D and C# back in 2014 in order to reach a 
        desired goal of creation. I have been able to release two games and two 
        studying apps (besides working on several prototypes, including 3D games) 
        as an independent developer.
